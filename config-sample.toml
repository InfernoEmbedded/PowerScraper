# Enable these sections to control battery charge/discharge on Solax SK-SU5000E inverters
# This does a number of things:
# 1. Allows more than 2 time periods through the day
# 2. Allows excess generation on 1 inverter to charge an inverter on another phase instead
#    of feeding that energy back to the grid (requires your billing meter to simply sum
#    usage across phases)
# 3. Allows inverters to share loads larger than what a single battery can discharge at
# 4. Allow grid charge up to a certain level (to allow enough energy stored to see you through
#    peak times)
